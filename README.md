# Chatbot-using-watson
Procedure to build:

step 1 : Open watson assistant-->
           Click Launch Watson Assistant. If you're prompted to log in, provide your IBM Cloud credentials.
            A new browser tab or window opens and Watson Assistant is displayed.
          
step 2 : Create an assistant-->
           An assistant is a cognitive bot to which you add skills that enable it to interact with your customers in useful ways.

step 3 : Create a dialog skill-->
           A dialog skill is a container for the artifacts that define the flow of a conversation that your assistant can have with your customers.
           
step 4 : Add intents from a content catalog-->
           The Intents page is where you start to train your assistant.Prebuilt intents are available from the content catalog. 
           You will give your assistant access to the General content catalog so your dialog can greet users, and end conversations with them.
           
step 5 : Build a dialog-->
           A dialog defines the flow of your conversation in the form of a logic tree. It matches intents (what users say) to responses (what your virtual assistant says back).              Each node of the tree has a condition that triggers it, based on user input.
           
step 6 : Integrate the assistants-->
          Now that you have an assistant that can participate in a simple conversational exchange, test it.
